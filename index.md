### During tectonic activities, fault interfaces sometimes do not slide relatively due to frictional obstruction. This blockage is called coupling.
### Studying the coupling properties is extremely important for earthquake prediction, seismic intensity zoning and insight into the very causes of earthquakes.
### Based on geodetic and seismological data, this study intends to process and obtain high-precision three-dimensional velocity field between the Japan subduction zone, further invert the latching nature of the fault plane in this region, and deeply explore the relationship between the coupling state and the zone where ruptures in earthquakes, then providing reference for regional earthquake disaster assessment.
